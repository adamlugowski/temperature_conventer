Task from ChatGPT

You need to write a Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should ask the user to input:

The temperature value they want to convert.
The unit of the temperature they are entering (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
The unit they want to convert the temperature to.
The program should then calculate and output the converted temperature.

Requirements:

The user should be able to enter temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
The program should convert the temperature into the desired unit.
Handle invalid inputs (e.g., invalid temperature units or non-numeric temperature values).
